# LightRay

LightRay is a simple toy ray tracing example that demonstrates the basics of ray tracing. It utilizes the Walnut project ([https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut)), Imgui, and Vulkan to create visualizations. This project serves as a starting point for me to learning about ray tracing techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with LightRay, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (or compatible versions)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) for Vulkan support
- [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) for project generation

## Getting Started

To set up the LightRay project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the LightRay repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/prakashrx/LightRay.git
cd LightRay
```

2. Run the `setup.bat` script located in the `scripts` directory. This script will generate the Visual Studio solution and project files:

```shell
scripts/Setup.bat
```

3.  Open the generated Visual Studio solution (`LightRay.sln`).
4.  Build the project using Visual Studio by selecting the appropriate configuration and hitting the build button.
